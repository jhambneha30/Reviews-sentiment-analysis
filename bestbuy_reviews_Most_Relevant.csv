apalmo_2023-06-13,5,Make your home really clean!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first Dyson and the first time using one in a very long time if every. I always thought they were just hyped up and overpriced vacuum cleaners. I was wrong, very wrong in fact and I'm glad to have the Dyson V15 Detect! I was suspect of this being a battery operated one because battery operated devices sometimes have less power or the power diminishes when low. I would only purchase plug in ones because I wanted the most power I could get. The Dyson V15 blows any plug-in vacuum I have ever had! The power is significant and does not diminish when the battery gets low. It was so powerful that it was picking up one of my smaller rugs when vacuuming. The battery does last a decent amount of time. I was able to vacuum my whole house about 3,000 square feet and had battery left over. The battery is removable so it should be an easy replacement if ever needed. On the vacuum there is a little menu that lets you choose power boost, eco, or auto for the power/battery. I tried boost and it makes the vacuum work at a high speed to give better suction. This is great for dog hair stuck in a fabric! I mostly use the vacuum on the auto setting. When in auto it will turn up the power when it detects more dirt, then goes back to a lower speed on lighter dirt. The display also shows the particulate matter that it sucked up. I'm not sure how accurate the display can show the different particulates, but it is still nice to have a little display to show that your vacuuming effort was worth it. The Dyson V15 comes with lots of attachments, pretty much anything you need to vacuum is covered. I was able to try most of them out and saw that they worked really well. We have short hair dogs and their fur is imbedded into our sofa. I have tried like three or four different vacuums and nothing will pull it out. So my first test with this Dyson was to use the Hair Screw Tool and see if it would work on the sofa. To my surprise it worked very well and was able to clean up a lot of the hair. Next I used the Digital Motorbar, which can be used on all floors but I just tried it on our rugs. It also worked better than expected and pulled up so much hair and dirt. The Crevice Tool, yeah its just a crevice tool, but it also lights up! I thought it was just gimmicky, but actually found the light to be helpfully when cleaning in hard to see or dark spaces. The soft dusting brush was nice to use on curtains, pictures, etc. My favorite is the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head. This is one where it lights up the floor green to show you dirt. Again I thought why is this a thing, then after using it, it totally makes sense! We have gray laminate flooring throughout the house, it hides a lot of dog hair, dirt, and dust. I thought my floors where pretty clean, but then using the Lase Cleaner Head it showed my floors where covered in dust and dog hair. The green laser makes it super easy to see all of this so you can do a better job at vacuuming. I now use this brush head anytime I vacuum the floors so I can make sure to get everything vacuumed up. It also comes with a Low-reach adaptor which is super handy to clean under furniture. Under my bed was a mess because we could never get the vacuum under them to clean, this attachment made the task super easy. Cleanup is simple, remove attachments, go to garbage can, pull red lever and all the dirt goes right into the trash. My prior stick vacuum whenever I would empty it, I would have dirt spill out or not go directly in the trash. There is also a docking station that you can mount to the wall. The docking station holds two attachments and can charge the vacuum. I really feel like Dyson thought of everything that a person would do with a vacuum and put it into this one. The build quality is great, it works great, the attachments are great, everything is great with this vacuum! If you need a new vacuum that can clean your home, car, whatever needs cleaning, this is the one to get!",apalmo,2023-06-13T00:21:40
AlexanderD_2023-10-01,5,"Simply, one of the best!","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Nothing short of spectacular! Vacuuming has now become less of a daily obligation and more of an engagingly immersive experience. This Dyson V15 Detect cordless vacuum cleaner offers incredible flexibility with its handful interchangeable brush tools and precision cleaning power modes, putting you in control of your desired outcome. The V15 Detect offers a display which calculates dirt particles and allows you to switch between suction modes ranging from Eco, Auto, and Boost modes! This feature ensures you with a superior job done! The hard floor brush tool also projects a laser light to project missed dirt and debris to guarantee an extra clean. Plus, it’s really fun to vacuum with this attachment in the dark! Worth the investment. Quality product with advanced technological attributes! I’d definitely recommend!",AlexanderD,2023-10-01T02:14:28
GamerDad_2023-06-08,5,This one could replace your plug-in vacuum,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Dyson V15 Detect Extra vacuum is a powerful cordless vacuum whose performance actually rivals that of our plug-in vacuum. I think “versatile” is the word that best describes the Dyson V15 Detect. It comes with a plethora of attachments that make any cleaning task from floors to ceiling fans a breeze. One of the included accessories is the wand storage clip. It allows onboard storage of two accessory attachments. I find it’s handy for the combination tool and the crevice tool. Both are used in multiple applications. The crevice tool has a light pipe on it that illuminates the area to be cleaned. It does a great job on stairs where they meet the wall and also where the stair tread meets the riser. The lighted crevice tool is also perfect in the car because it allows me to see into and reach the dark recesses under the seats. The mini soft dusting brush made short work of removing the dust from the blinds in the kitchen and bedrooms. It has soft, flexible bristles, so it also does a bang-up job around tabletop decorations without disrupting their arrangement. The Digital Motorbar cleaner is a general-purpose vacuum head that does a great job on carpeting and rugs. It has a three-position slider to vary suction power, and that’s a good thing. On max suction, it was picking up the area rugs. Sliding it down to the minimum suction setting allows me to clean the area rugs without incident. I found that it does a good job along baseboards if I keep the head perpendicular to the baseboard, cleaning from the extreme right or left side of the head. If I pushed the head forward into the baseboard, it inevitably left behind some debris. That’s okay because the swivel head is extremely maneuverable and a turn of the wrist is all it takes to capture any fugitives from cleanup. There is another cleaner head called the “Fluffy Optic” cleaner. It projects a green light across solid surface flooring in front of the cleaner head and makes any debris stand out for easy location and cleaning. Even dust that would otherwise go unnoticed becomes glaringly obvious, and the Dyson V15 Detect does a great job of capturing even the smallest particles. A wall mount charging station is included for a convenient storage option that means your Dyson V15 Detect Extra is always ready to go to work. Alternatively, the battery is removable and can be charged while off the vacuum body. I appreciate the versatility these charging options allow. There is a color digital display that communicates vacuum status Including battery charge percentage, power setting (Eco, Medium, or Boost), and realtime details of dirt levels being picked up and remaining run time. Regarding the amount of dirt being picked up, the vacuum monitors what’s being collected in real time and automatically adjusts motor speed to effectively balance cleaning power and efficiency. Packaging indicates a run time of up to 60 minutes. I vacuumed our entire first floor, a screen porch, stairs, and a carpet runner in the garage, a project that took about 45 minutes. When I plugged in the vacuum for recharge, it indicated there was 30 percent capacity remaining. Following the first-floor vacuum, the large dust cup was pretty full. Emptying is as easy as pushing a lever on the back of the vacuum body forward. Contents of the dust cup drop into the trash. Pull the lever back into position, close the lid on the bottom of the cup, and it’s ready to go. If I have any criticism of the Dyson V15 Detect, it would be the weight and the power switch. After 30-plus minutes of continuous operation, it starts to get a little heavy. More than that, the trigger-style switch must be continuously depressed to keep the vacuum running. It’s conveniently located right where the index finger falls while holding the vacuum, but extended cleaning sessions can cause some fatigue. I think I prefer the on/off buttons of our other cordless vacuums. My impression of the Dyson V15 Detect Extra is overwhelmingly positive. It matches the performance of our plug-in vacuums in a convenient cordless package. The included accessories mean that no job is out of reach.",GamerDad,2023-06-08T18:06:51
Kaizoku_2023-06-10,5,Powerful suction and eye-opening dust detection!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Quick Overview ================================= The Dyson V15 Detect Extra is Dyson's most powerful vacuum to-date with a ton of accessories and a key new feature that may make it the best choice for those with pets, lots of long hair, and hard floors. This specific model from Best Buy also includes a pivoting right-angle tool that will help you get low under tables or furniture or high onto a ledge or shelf. Overall build and setup ================================= If you haven't used/owned a Dyson vacuum before, you're getting arguably one of the best-engineered vacuums out there. Much time (and money) have been spent on technology and R&D to develop a new suction method to provide powerful suction and filtration without losing power over time. The build is mostly plastic with their signature style including a bottom-mounted battery which leads to a grip that connects to the central suction/canister areas. You'll see a much larger canister here than on the older/smaller v6-8 models. See my pictures for a size comparison with a V7. Overall it's well-balanced and comfortable to hold. You get a ton of attachments, some which require a special callout: --Main shaft, crevice tool, right-angle adapter, fine brush, coarse brush w/extension, wall mount, carrying clip (for your favorite tool) and... --Fluffy Optic - this is made for hard floors and is the standout new one that has a low-angle green laser that illuminates dust (so much dust!) --Anti-Tangle Comb - this head is good for all floors and has high-torque to really get things clean. It has a special feature to keep hair off the rollers --Anti-Tangle Screw Hair Tool - this narrow head has a ""screw"" design which should ball up hair for pickup so it doesn't wrap around the vacuum filter in the canister One big thing you'll want to know: This doesn't have a push-button on/off. This is a trigger that must be held to use. For those that don't/can't use trigger-style vacuums, you may need to shop around. The first thing you'll want to do is plug it in to charge fully, then complete the setup which consists of selecting your language (English, in this case) and battery mode (Eco for longest life, lowest suction; Medium, for automatic adjustments; High for maximum power). Another thing you'll note is there's no mention of HEPA filtration on this model, but they do talk about the ability to filter up to 0.3 microns and expel cleaner air. Performance ================================= This is a powerful vacuum! In a house with no pets, but three girls with long hair, this grabbed hair on floors, carpets, and rugs without issue. I will say that some hair did get onto the internal filter in the canister, but perhaps we didn't get everything using the Screw Hair Tool first. I believe the ""order of operations"" should be to use the Screw Hair Tool to get your hair/fur off of most surfaces first, then use the proper tool for hard floors or carpets (Fluffy Optic or ""standard"" with Anti-Tangle Comb). After that, you'd use the smaller brushes, crevice tool, etc. As you vacuum with the Fluffy Optic, you'll see things you wish you could unsee... Yes, that bright green laser which is precisely angled will highlight all the dust and dander that you never really noticed before. It's literally an eye-opener in terms of clearly seeing what you're vacuuming up and what you've left behind (or not yet gotten to). For completionists and power-washer fans, it's a great attachment that will help you see your progress. On top of that, the rear face of the V15 shows you a bar graph with 4 categories based on the size of the particles being sucked up! From tiny allergens to crumbs/sugar-sized ones, you can see what you're cleaning. For those with allergies or sensitivity to fine dust, this can really help show if you've done a good enough job cleaning or not. I plan to establish somewhat of a ""baseline"" by keeping track of the numbers and seeing if there's any improvement as I continue to vacuum over a week/month/etc. It'd be nice if the Dyson app (used to register your V15) provided more than just marketing info, usage guides, and rudimentary troubleshooting. What if it could keep track of your stats for you? High-power mode is great, but short-lived. I didn't run down the battery, but only use this when you really need it. As for Eco mode, I could see that doing a great job if you have a lot of hard floors to clean with just dust to worry about. It should last near the stated 60-minute runtime. As for medium/auto, this is probably the best default mode if you're dealing with mixed surfaces and possible fur/hair along with dust and crumbs. You can hear the motor/suction adjusting as you vacuum based on what types/size particles it's detecting. We're getting more than 30 minutes of runtime in this mode which is enough to take care of vacuuming tasks, especially if you do it once a week or more often. How did the V15 Detect deal with 3 girls' long hair? Well, it did get them off any surface we had, but cleaning the canister wasn't as easy as just pushing the release into a bin. The long hair (> 16"") did get tangled around the internal filters so it required removing the entire clear canister to get the hair (and dust) off. I would not recommend doing this inside since things get messy. Doing this outside, halfway into your trash bin or bag is best, and watch out for the wind direction! Conclusion ================================= I'd say this is the probably the best cleaning tool we have in the house to-date. We also use a Dyson V7 and an LG CordZero A9. Compared to those, this V15 Detect is certainly bigger and more powerful. Unlike the LG, there's a trigger-mechanism here which may be a deal-breaker for some. Overall though, I do love the Fluffy Optic brush with the green dust illuminator. There's no doubt your floors are getting cleaner when you can literally see the dust that you may have left behind with your other vacuums. Not only that, you can see the stats on the back of the vacuum, showing the types of particles you're getting. I'd say this vacuum (or one of Dyson's other HEPA ones) along with some good air filters should keep homes squeaky-clean for those that are sensitive to dust and dander. I can't stress this enough, the illumination is literally eye-opening and will show you more dust than you care to know you have! This Dyson V15 Detect Extra has definitely made it into the regular cleaning rotation and I think the V7 is about to retire as a small ""spot"" or car vacuum.",Kaizoku,2023-06-10T02:28:34
heavyplague_2025-01-04,5,"It sucks, which is a good thing",[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this for my wife. We wanted something that was a little lighter than our other vacuum. It was easy to put together and easy to use. I was amazed as to how much that this vacuum picked up. It also has an auto adjustment that controls the vacuum intensity due to the amount of dirt it is picking up. You can also set it to eco for longer battery life or full boost for very dirty areas. It has a gauge for how much of the various size material it has picked up.,heavyplague,2025-01-04T00:38:59
Vladislav_2024-07-23,1,"Emptying bin issue, same as usual with Dyson","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hoped Dyson fixed issue to make easier fully empty trash bin. But, I guess not. They did raised price drastically, though. In order you to empty fully bin, you have to use some stick to pull it out and get dirt everywhere. Dyson, if you can came out with ideas, look at least around and learn from your competitors...",Vladislav,2024-07-23T18:25:46
momonabudget_2023-11-19,5,Dog Hair Houdini,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Multi dog home has finally met its match! I have tried every vaccum on the market claiming do the near impossible, clean the dog hair from every surface. The Dyson V15 is the only vacuum living up to its reviews. This vacuum pulls the hair from the material of the cushions with a couple passes where other vacuums I’ve purchased would fail to pull the hair with several passes. I would find myself frustrated and unable to get back that time or my OCD sanity. Worth every penny. It is clean, efficient, and honestly FUN! I’ve included i few pictures demonstrating the Dyson accepting the challenge of not only removing the dog hair, but the dander as well! Super gross and SUPER satisfying to see the dander removed.",momonabudget,2023-11-19T16:28:22
RobertW_2023-08-26,5,Dyson V15 Cordless Vac,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I knew someone who has one and likes it. I was looking for a cordless to stop tripping over the cord. One of the attachments features a bright green light at floor level to show particles of dirt to get, which works really well. The vac comes with a variety of attachments and a wall-mounted storage/charging station, easy to install. The only minor issue I should have anticipated was the weight of the mechanical part, which is a little tiring on the wrist and arm but not badly so. It picks up everything well and displays it in a clear tube, which is easy to empty. I also appreciated the customer support I got at Best Buy, purchased at a good price and arranging for pickup at a store in a different state. Altogether, the product and the buying experience were superior.",RobertW,2023-08-26T14:10:19
GaryY_2024-03-01,5,Dyson V15 Detect,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this Dyson V 15 detect two months ago I owned the original Dyson ball several years ago as well as the original. Dyson was a good vacuum. It was very heavy and Cumbus some to get around. I find the V5 as much more powerful as way more suction and is a lot lighter because it’s a cordless. The Dyson V5 also sports some great features that you don’t normally see on the vacuum one of them being a green laser light on the hardwood floor attachment that makes it very easy to see dust that you would not normally see with your eye I’m very happy I decided on the Dyson V 15 I feel it’s worth every penny I paid,GaryY,2024-03-01T21:43:13
Phil278_2024-02-14,5,Light vac that sucks with strength,"I've had Dyson products in the past and have loved them. I'd been eying the v15 Detect for a while and am happy to say that it does not disappoint. I have a roomba-like vacuum robot runs daily and when I use the v15 after it, I can see where the robot's missed things or moved it around. It's light, easy to use, and so much better than my prior cordless stick vac. It's also been great to use with the carpet attachment and that is also so much better than the other stick vac. The power to really clean the carpet with dug-in dust and grime is obvious. I had heard that the dead-man switch to power the vac can be tiring but it's not at all an issue. I love the v15 Detect.",Phil278,2024-02-14T20:31:27
Shelbyguy72_2023-11-14,5,Dyson V15Detect,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is our very first Dyson. I can't believe how well this thing works. We absolutely love it. We have 2 dogs with 1 being a Husky and she sheds all the time. We keep her groomed and brush her regularly and it still looks like we have fur babies all over the house. The vacuum gives you the ability to see what you are vacuuming and what you may have missed. It has a bunch of different attachments that are very useful to have. I am so glad we purchased the bigger V15 instead of the V12. We have a larger house so the V15 was well worth are purchase. Thanks Dyson for helping us clean!,Shelbyguy72,2023-11-14T06:50:55
EVbestbuy_2024-08-09,5,Really well built and well though unit,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Outstanding unit for two major reasons- first the new hard floor head unit has the green light that shows all dust and second the narrow crack head unit also has a new light that helps when running down dark deep places - also motor auto modulates for equal suction without changing to boost,EVbestbuy,2024-08-09T13:49:27
Trex_2023-09-23,5,Ms,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love it, wish battery life is longer. Love the extra head and other accessories that comes with it. Highly recommended to those who loves to deep clean the house with pets.",Trex,2023-09-23T00:38:11
Mike_2024-11-13,4,A real mixed bag,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I first bought this. I liked it a lot. There are some real pros going for this vacuum. It has a light on the hardwood floor attachment so when you’re vacuuming, you can see any dust or dirt. That’s fabulous unfortunately you have to keep changing heads, depending on if you’re on a carpet or hard surface, and it is a heavy vacuum. Also, there are two little round buttons that if you accidentally bumped something, they fall off and break and Dyson won’t replace them Because they call it not normal, where. The vacuum still works without them. I think it’s too much to expect customers never to bump into something with the vacuum cleaner! It cleans well because you can adjust the amount of suction that you need. I would not buy it again. It’s a little heavy for me.",Mike,2024-11-13T14:13:11
bekah717_2024-02-08,5,Overall a winner,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love most of this Dyson. That being said, the big attachments are great for the floors especially the fluffy one that lights up and shows the dust. It picks up a ton. I have a cat who sheds constantly. And most of the other attachments work great as well especially the one for your furniture/bedding. Now the lighted crevice tool isn’t so great. Yeah it lights up but to me the suction isn’t great. But another great thing about this vacuum is the detachable battery so you can charge it by itself.",bekah717,2024-02-08T17:35:11
Toddp_2024-06-16,5,Excellent Vacuum(s),"This is my 5th Dyson. I’ve had 4 handheld vacuums (a v6- v7 animal- v8 absolute and a v11 animal. This machine is my 5th handled and it’s outstanding. I love the green laser on the fluffy. It’s amazing and gross, how much buildup of hair and dirt is on my hard surfaces. Great choice. I love my Dyson ball too. I have a ton of carpet and it amazes me how much dirt and hair the ball picks up too. I’d recommend the Dyson products to everyone. They are worth the money.",Toddp,2024-06-16T18:41:09
Hillyo_2024-11-28,5,Game changer in the vacuum world,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Absolutely obsessed with this vacuum. Cannot imagine living my life without this thing now that I’ve had it for a few weeks. For years, I’ve wanted a cordless Dyson vacuum and kept pushing it off because of the price point. Well, safe to say I’m THRILLED I finally got the bullet and got one. If you have pets who she’d like crazy, this thing will show you how dirty your floors are no matter how clean you think they are from your shedding pets!!! It cleans on carpet really well too. Cannot imagine not owning a Dyson now that I’ve had it for a few weeks. I vacuum every single day and it picks up so much every day.",Hillyo,2024-11-28T23:35:59
AshleeC_2025-01-11,5,Dyson never disappoints!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Battery life is incredible compared to previous models. I live that the light on the head of the vacuum shows you invisible dust and dander. The suction level adapts to the level needed when switching from hard wood, linoleum, and then to carpet. I love that the LCD screen shows you exactly what’s been sucked up and how long of a change is left to complete the tasks you need. The reservoir holds quite a bit and is very easy to clean out! Absolutely Love this!",AshleeC,2025-01-11T03:48:42
AmyF_2025-03-24,5,Supreme vacuum,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been really impressed with the Dyson V15. It’s a powerhouse vacuum that automatically adjusts suction based on the mess, which makes cleaning super easy. Whether you’re switching from hard floors to carpets or dealing with tight corners, it handles everything smoothly. Plus, the battery lasts long enough to get the whole house done in one go. Overall, it’s a great upgrade for anyone who wants an effortless cleaning experience.",AmyF,2025-03-24T01:01:42
Kyle_2023-11-15,5,Best Vacuum I’ve ever bought.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This thing is incredible. With the dust light I have become addicted to cleaning. I love/hate it. It’s very satisfying using this dust light feature and seeing how dirty our floors are before then how clean after. It’s incredibly light and easy to maneuver. My wife loves the detachable heads and accessories. A must have with pets that make your furniture incredibly fuzzy. Highly recommend this vacuum.,Kyle,2023-11-15T18:27:45

Bigwake_2024-01-26,5,The Beast is Better Than Ever!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Since my first upright Animal 15 years ago, Dyson doesn't disappoint. With two 140 lb dogs and 4 very fuzzy cats, we have plenty of hair on everything. This unit really picks up the dirt and hair and gone are the hair clogs on revolving heads. Super long battery life, smart attachments, this new unit will make a fine addition to my other Dyson units in the barn, garage, office and my original Animal still running strong after all these years. You get what you pay for and Dyson is worth the price. Got hair, got dust and dirt - Dyson makes it easy maintenance free cleaning.",Bigwake,2024-01-26T21:25:33
JermondL_2024-09-06,5,Best Investment of the Year,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Better than I could have ever imagined. 1. On my hardwood floors I never imagined I'd see that much debris since I sweep daily, but wow this was an eye opener. My floors are way cleaner now as I now have visibility into how clean they really are. 2. On my carpet, I saw how much was left behind from my previous vacuum cleaner (had to empty the canister twice). 3. In the car, it did the job I usually head to the car wash to handle. One a whole, I'd recommend this vacuum to everyone as it's worth every penny. Hands down the best and most versatile vacuum I've ever owned.",JermondL,2024-09-06T16:52:34

RANDALLP_2023-12-30,5,Worth every penny.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This vacuum is worth the money! We had our previous Dyson for 7 years. It still works fine, it’s just not as young as it used to be. I honestly thought the green light was a gimmick, but find it definitely helps keep you on track to get every speck of dust/dirt. Our home is 2600 sq ft and 90% of that is wood floors. The battery last plenty of time to get the job done. Also, one little thing that is great is the engineers let the wall mounted bracket line up with the holes of our previous Dyson. We hung it back in the same place with no extra holes in the wall.",RANDALLP,2023-12-30T00:18:00

Bob27_2023-07-28,5,Super vac,"None of the manuals provided information on how to put the pieces together. This model has the built-in crevice tool which made the assembly a bit more tricky. Other than that, this is by far the best vac I have ever used. My last purchase was the v10 and this baby is miles above that model. Love the lighted debris picker upper, the built-in crevice tool; I like how smoothly and easily the wand comes apart to change our heads. I like the elimination system. The standing dock is marvelous. This vac is noticeably more quiet than my previous model. I hope that these positives last and that the vac lives up to my initial impressions for years to come.",Bob27,2023-07-28T22:29:00
BigE_2025-03-23,5,Best vacuum ever.,"I have had this vacuum for two weeks and I have to say it has far exceeded my expectation on what a hand held vacuum can clean. My old Dyson stick vacuum lasted 18 years so I understood you get what you pay for in a vacuum. The new vacuum is so much better than the one It replaced because it picks up so much more pet fur. One review I read said the lady replaced her large push around vacuum with the stick vacuum because the stick vacuum was all she now needed. I did not believe her but, I can now say she is 100% correct. The led light on the hard wood floor attachment is a great addition as you can see what needs to be vacuumed or if you miss a spot. If you are on the fence about buying this vacuum just do it, you will not regret it .",BigE,2025-03-23T13:53:44
Lynn58_2025-03-28,5,Absolutely Brilliant!!!,"Absolutely brilliant!!! Having used only a cylinder Dyson previously I took the plunge and invested in the V15 cordless model and I have not been disappointed. It cleans so much better than I would have expected,considering I hoovered daily. It comes well packaged to the usual Dyson standard and with all the attachments which are easy to swap over when required. The battery lasts long enough to complete all my room's and any added extras I can find to do!!! I found it quieter than my old cylinder model and it saves on power as it switches off when you take your pressure off the on/off switch. Computerised handle showing you all the different types of dust etc being hoovered up is rather interesting [if you like that sort of thing!!] No more leads,hoses being stretched over furniture or searching for attachments, just press and off you go. Emptying is easy with the side lever,it's able to be kept clean with a damp cloth and with a washable filter,what's not to love about this machine. I'm very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend this model.",Lynn58,2025-03-28T18:30:39
Kelsea_2023-12-08,5,I LOVE this vacuum,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This thing is incredible. Im still trying to figure out if its worth the price tag, however if you have a best buy credit card, they offer affordable, intrest free financing so that's what i opted for. This thing cleans phenominally. I was skeptical at first if this tiny thing would be able to effectively clean my mostly carpet house, but its surpassed my expectations by a ton. I have a kitty who sheds like nothing else and this thing picks up so much fur and dirt. The amount of dirt it picks up is actually kind of scary, but at the same time, i feel better knowing its out of my carpet. The included attachments are so convenient. Im able to vacuum my couch, stairs and corners so easily. Being 32 weeks pregnant, that's a huge bonus for me. Its pretty quiet compared to a plug in vacuum as well. I love that its cordless. No more lugging around a heavy vacuum and plagging it in and having to maneuver around the chord. The battery doesnt last super long especially if you use the boost mode, but i usually use it on auto and im able to get my entire house done and have some battery left and it still picks up a sickly anount of dirt and hair. I actually enjoy vacuuming now and thats something i thought i would never say. My only issue with it is that it struggles with taller carpets like the ones i have in my upstairs. If i run it on anything other than the eco mode, the brushes dont move. With that being said, even on eco mode, it still picks up a ton of stuff. If you have the money and are questioning if this is worth it, i promise you, it is!!",Kelsea,2023-12-08T21:47:22
ERDoc1_2024-07-19,5,Love my Dyson,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had this for several weeks and love it. My precious Dyson lost a lot of suction power after a few years so had to replace. I did a lot of research and watched a lot YouTube reviews. It came down to the Dyson vs Tineco. They were both reviewed as top 2 for sure. The clincher for me was that Tineco had a much smaller collection bin. It was also a bit cheaper. I have a large space to vacuum so I went with Dyson. If you have a lot dog hair empty frequently to or it could jam up. Only downside was the price. But….I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. J also have one of Dysons uprights as well as Tine o floor cleaner. Both excellent brands.,ERDoc1,2024-07-19T15:20:57
Lolabell_2023-09-03,5,"Makes me actually want to vacuum, and cat approved","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This vacuum! I live in an old building that is incredibly dusty, have a cat and have sinus issues and allergies - this vacuum has made a real difference. I have had an original ball Dyson for 14+ years, it still works well, but wanted something lighter, quieter, cordless, but still able to really clean. I made the mistake of buying a shark cordless, and it just did not do a good job, so I decided to splurge for the Dyson v15. I”should have started with the Dyson, but am happy I figured it out and now have the Dyson V15 detect. First, the main attachment for rugs and multi-surfaces does as well or better than my old Dyson workhorse. and it’s quieter, which my cat appreciates, he no longer disappears for hours under a bed when I vacuum. I have hardwood floors and area rugs throughout my apartment and my favorite tool and feature is the fluffy floor - optic cleaner head - it is amazing. You might think your floors are clean, but this shows where the dust is and does a remarkable job really cleaning the floors. The fluffy optic head turns and maneuvers easily to fit under just about anything. It is so easy to use, that I am able to do a quick morning and evening pass through the kitchen, halls, and where the litter box lives - and my apartment is much cleaner. actually LIKE using it! The other tools are helpful and have been put to good use, it is easy to empty to bin without mess, it quickly becomes a handheld, it is quieter, holds the charge well, have been able to vacuum the entire apartment without any issues. I never thought I would say this about a vacuum, but I love this machine and actually like vacuuming now.",Lolabell,2023-09-03T15:11:26
