Lynn58_2025-03-28,5,Absolutely Brilliant!!!,"Absolutely brilliant!!! Having used only a cylinder Dyson previously I took the plunge and invested in the V15 cordless model and I have not been disappointed. It cleans so much better than I would have expected,considering I hoovered daily. It comes well packaged to the usual Dyson standard and with all the attachments which are easy to swap over when required. The battery lasts long enough to complete all my room's and any added extras I can find to do!!! I found it quieter than my old cylinder model and it saves on power as it switches off when you take your pressure off the on/off switch. Computerised handle showing you all the different types of dust etc being hoovered up is rather interesting [if you like that sort of thing!!] No more leads,hoses being stretched over furniture or searching for attachments, just press and off you go. Emptying is easy with the side lever,it's able to be kept clean with a damp cloth and with a washable filter,what's not to love about this machine. I'm very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend this model.",Lynn58,2025-03-28T18:30:39

DarshanaW_2025-03-28,5,Works great,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Easy to handle and it works great. It would have been better if the battery power charge last longer,DarshanaW,2025-03-28T15:29:24
Roger_2025-03-28,5,Worth the Hype,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This cordless vaccum is unlike any other. I especially love the green light it shines on your floor to highlight dust/dirt that you'd never even see on your floor or that gets missed by other vacuums. I wish the batter ran longer but the suction power is great, even on the medium setting. I also love the fact that this Dyson provides you stats - for example, how many dust particles it's cleaned.",Roger,2025-03-28T06:36:23
Darcie36_2025-03-28,5,Great product!!,"I used my tax return for this, and I am so glad I did. It is easy to maneuver. I cannot believe all the dirt in my carpet. It is also easy to dump in the garbage.",Darcie36,2025-03-28T00:29:37
Rcc1_2025-03-27,5,Amazing vacuum,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent vacuum, best I’ve ever owned. Easy to use and very effective.",Rcc1,2025-03-27T22:30:04
Fede_2025-03-27,3,Not as great as expected,"I bought the V15 detect like a month ago, my expectations were so high because Dyson is a very well known brand and I was reviewing different brands and models to see what was the best for me. My condo is hardwood floor, not very challenging from that point so I decided to go with Dyson. Unfortunately the battery is not the best AT ALL!!! 3 hours or so to fully charge and when in use it only last 40min….and maybe less. The other aspect was the suction power, I was expecting a powerful vacuum that when just 1 move you can pick all the dust, dirt and small things from the floor but it seems that you need to pass and pass and pass the vacuum several times to see the floor clean, small size debris on the floor are difficult to pick. So basically I’d say to anyone looking for a new device, think twice and maybe another brand would be better and cheaper.",Fede,2025-03-27T15:17:45
Reid_2025-03-26,4,Good wireless vacuum,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good vacuum. Powerful and not too difficult to hold. A bit top heavy and rollers get bogged down when cleaning carpet or even stops. But the convenience of a cordless vacuum outweighs the negatives.,Reid,2025-03-26T19:14:18
Mustang_2025-03-26,5,Perfect product with excellent deal.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product is suitable for indoor and outdoor cleaning.,Mustang,2025-03-26T15:58:42
marble soup_2025-03-26,5,Great cordless vacuum,"I love Dyson cordless vacuums. The V15 Detect is lightweight and performs the best! If there was a negative and only a slight negative it would be nice for older people to be able to have a push button turn off/turn on feature, for some older folks holding the turn on button can be hard on arthritic hands. All in all this is a great lightweight that cleans beyond expectations.",marble soup,2025-03-26T11:08:19
MalissaG_2025-03-25,4,Maybe too good,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This vacuum has great suction, maybe a little too good. The suction makes it almost impossible to vacuum out living room and bedroom throw rugs - it causes the rug to “roll up on itself”. It works GREAT on hard floors especially with the green laser light showing the dust and debris on the floor. We have a Labrador who sheds constantly, and this vacuum picks up his hair very well.",MalissaG,2025-03-25T22:47:38
DenisseI_2025-03-25,5,Dyson,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Amazing vacuum. Works really well on both carpet and tile.,DenisseI,2025-03-25T20:30:29

JenniferB_2025-03-24,4,Disappointed 6,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use slide cat litter and for those if who don't know, it's like the softest beach sand omu have ever felt. So I I had very high expectations for this as I thought to do the trick. But I have to go over the same spots over and over again and still find some on the ground so I end up having to use my big vacuum. So if you don't have any cat litter like that it'll work great for you but not what I expected",JenniferB,2025-03-24T15:35:37
Dusty Shopper_2025-03-24,3,Floors clean. Hands dirty!!,"I love to use it. I HATE to empty it!! The hair gets stuck at the top. The canister is longer and slides down. This makes it extremely difficult to ""reach"" what is trapped at the top of the canister. To avoid using my fingers I had to dedicate and sacrifice a kitchen utensil to get the clumps. Disgusting! Didn't any of you clowns have dogs and rugs. I like the V8 much better.",Dusty Shopper,2025-03-24T10:14:37

AmyF_2025-03-24,5,Supreme vacuum,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been really impressed with the Dyson V15. It’s a powerhouse vacuum that automatically adjusts suction based on the mess, which makes cleaning super easy. Whether you’re switching from hard floors to carpets or dealing with tight corners, it handles everything smoothly. Plus, the battery lasts long enough to get the whole house done in one go. Overall, it’s a great upgrade for anyone who wants an effortless cleaning experience.",AmyF,2025-03-24T01:01:42
Vicky_2025-03-23,5,Amazing vacuum,"I bought a few weeks ago and the suction on it is amazing, we had an old corded Dyson before and this is so much better at picking up the dirt. The pet attachment picks all the hair up our rugs have never been this clean since we bought them. Battery lasts very well and noise level is low. We are so happy we bought.",Vicky,2025-03-23T17:38:39
BigE_2025-03-23,5,Best vacuum ever.,"I have had this vacuum for two weeks and I have to say it has far exceeded my expectation on what a hand held vacuum can clean. My old Dyson stick vacuum lasted 18 years so I understood you get what you pay for in a vacuum. The new vacuum is so much better than the one It replaced because it picks up so much more pet fur. One review I read said the lady replaced her large push around vacuum with the stick vacuum because the stick vacuum was all she now needed. I did not believe her but, I can now say she is 100% correct. The led light on the hard wood floor attachment is a great addition as you can see what needs to be vacuumed or if you miss a spot. If you are on the fence about buying this vacuum just do it, you will not regret it .",BigE,2025-03-23T13:53:44

Kayak4_2025-03-21,5,Love my Dyson,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have seen many reviews about these more expensive Dyson vacuums. I did purchase this one on sale for about $100 off. I’ve seen deals where they are lower than that. That being said, this is the best cordless vacuum I’ve ever used. The suction is unbelievable compared to the other cordless vac I had (not comparable in price, but still well over $200), the battery lasts forever, and I absolutely love the display that basically count down the minutes I have left for battery life. The extra accessories with this particular set are amazing. If you price them out on Dyson separately, you would be paying hundreds more.",Kayak4,2025-03-21T16:10:13
CBD4ALL_2025-03-21,5,Satisfied Dyson Customer,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very pleased with our purchase of the Dyson-V15 and it's accompanying accessories as it does a great job!,CBD4ALL,2025-03-21T15:41:15

DeronJ_2025-03-20,5,Chefs Kiss,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Oh MY GOSH is all I can say about this vacuum!! I was so hesitant to spend this much, or buy into this just for the name but now I could kick myself for not doing it sooner!! Super lightweight, has amazing suction (even with 2 dogs & 2 cats), and the wall mount is an added bonus. The only thing I see that’s unnecessary is the screen showing the size of the particles it picks up. I don’t have one bad thing to say and I’ve had it over 2 yrs. I will NEVER buy another brand or another corded vacuum. This is 10/10",DeronJ,2025-03-20T15:05:16

MelAsh06_2025-03-17,5,Dream on wood but a pain on carpet.,This vacuum is a dream on wood floors. I love that I can see all the dust and hair before it sucks it right up. But it is kinda of a pain on carpet. You will need some strength to push it forward.,MelAsh06,2025-03-17T17:37:23
ServiceGoat_2025-03-17,2,Horrible service on parts and support,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Cordless feature is great, and it makes cleaner more frequently a lot easier. Great suction and the quality of cleaning is also great. However, a key piece broke off that helps it turn/maneuver in December 2024, and 4 months later we are still getting the runaround on getting the replacement part. So, the 2-year warranty isn't worth a whole lot. They offered to send us a cheaper vacuum with less features if we ship all of the broken vacuum in including all the attachments. This is pretty horrible service on a $500+ vacuum. Would not recommend Dyson again, and this is our third Dyson.",ServiceGoat,2025-03-17T15:43:28
Jamisha_2025-03-17,5,Love it and so glad i chose this one,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Best vacuum I’ve ever owned and therfore does everything i need it to do. Battery sometimes doesn’t last long but you have different options to choose from like eco mode. Definitely would recommend this to everyone!,Jamisha,2025-03-17T02:47:12
PinkyC_2025-03-16,5,Powerful suction,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Finally a vacuum cleaner that can pick all the pet hair off my carpets and hardwood floors. Comes with multiple attachments to tackle different flooring types and pet beds, etc. Battery makes it somewhat heavyweight though, but worth the money.",PinkyC,2025-03-16T20:55:29

Cvictor806_2025-03-14,5,Upgrading from a V8,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Upgraded from a V8 and super happy with the power and attachments included. The light is great because you can see the dirt/dust in the way of the vacuum. Took me a bit to choose but ultimately I decided that the V15 was worth the price. I have had the V8 for almost 6 years now and it is still going strong, if the V15 lasts me the same amount of years I will be happy with the purchase.",Cvictor806,2025-03-14T23:12:14
lhiro_2025-03-14,5,Dyson V-15,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We got the Dyson - V15 because our Dyson V-8 battery would not recharge any more and the vacuum itself was cracked in many places from use. The V-15 is heaver than the V-8 but it does Vacuum a lot better. The battery life is definitely longer and I do like the fact that the battery on the V-15 can be replaced! There are many more features on this Vacuum that our V-8 did not have, that makes the weight difference not so bad.",lhiro,2025-03-14T20:47:36
