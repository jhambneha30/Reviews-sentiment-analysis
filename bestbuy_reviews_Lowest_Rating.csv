Nate_2025-03-13,1,Battery pack issues,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Did a good job on hard floors, especially like the light for illuminating pet hair and debris. Did not like how we had to change the head switch between carpet and hard floors, it kind of negates the advantage of being cordless. We ended up having to return because the battery pack started falling out of the unit and eventually we could not get it to ""click"" in at all and so it stopped working. This was after 7 days of owning it. I would not recommend, especially at this high price point. I'm sure you can do just as good for under $200.",Nate,2025-03-13T14:56:05
Tired_2025-03-05,1,CAN'T GET PART,"Love the Dyson V15 DETECT, but I have been waiting for the missing piece for months with an open ticket.",Tired,2025-03-05T18:40:50
Carlos_2025-02-21,1,Worst idea ever.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Vacuum is not only expensive but the suction power is really not that great, it stopped adjustin the suction power when it changes from hardwood floor to carpet, and the worst part about this vacumm is by far when you try to empty it, all the hair gets stuck on the top and you have to put your hanside and pull it out while all of the dust and dirt fly everywhere, there are many other older models that work much better than this one.",Carlos,2025-02-21T11:26:04
Kwrupp_2025-01-10,1,Failed after two years,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] At first I loved this vacuum. It’s like no other. Originally purchased December of 2022. However, come January 2025 the vacuum is nothing more than a door stop. After I press the trigger it does not remain on. I’ve consulted support and forums and tried everything from cleaning the filter, replacing the filter, checking for blockages, etc. all to no avail. It seems the problem stems from a faulty power switch/ trigger. It’s a known issue for this model and Dyson has done nothing to remedy. Do your research. For a premium product it’s sad that it only lasts 2 years. Shame on Dyson.",Kwrupp,2025-01-10T23:42:58
Tj128_2025-01-09,1,Don't do it!,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overpriced junk! low battery life top heavy along with being unimpressive.,Tj128,2025-01-09T03:35:58
UnhappyCustomer_2024-12-27,1,Price Guarantee Policy is NOT for real.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very disappointed with Bedt Buy price match policy. Went to the store and showed them a $50.00 difference in price.,UnhappyCustomer,2024-12-27T16:28:19
Irritated_2024-12-19,1,Junk,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical in purchasing. The vacuum seemed to work fine for about 10 minutes and then the brush head quit spinning. Seems like Dyson missed the mark on this one.,Irritated,2024-12-19T17:51:18
User_2024-12-17,1,Dyson v15,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It stop speening on second day of purchase. Running time is short. Buttery is dying too fast.,User,2024-12-17T19:13:41
LindaB_2024-12-08,1,Do not buy dyson,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very disappointed. Bought for white dog hair on wood floor. Suction not good and can’t finish house without battery dying. I am looking for new vacuum .,LindaB,2024-12-08T05:27:53
TugrulT_2024-11-23,1,Over expensive garbage,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had several cordless Dyson vacuums and they all died on me. I bought a $100 one over the internet that does the job. Dyson is over-expensive, not worth.",TugrulT,2024-11-23T13:05:12
Shak_2024-10-04,1,Over priced and poor,"I brought this in August and didn’t use it straightaway, wish I did as I would have returned this immediately!! The suction is poor even on boost mode I’ve got two babies under the ages of two the idea was quick n easy but no its worse hoover I ever purchased!!",Shak,2024-10-04T19:57:46
tmw131_2024-08-12,1,airway blocked ... always - don't spend the money,"I just expected more from this very expensive vacuum, regardless of the attachment or the floor I'm cleaning, it shuts down and tells me there's a airway blockage, I've cleaned it more than I care to share and it still doesn't work.",tmw131,2024-08-12T18:26:20
fplay_2024-08-11,1,Not worth the $…..,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Has the power to suck the money out of your wallet or purse because just after a year your looking for another one once the trigger breaks, the casing around the battery breaks and the stick connecter to the brush breaks also. Look elsewhere unless you want to give Dyson all your money, Yeah go for it! Its sucks!",fplay,2024-08-11T11:07:29
Vladislav_2024-07-23,1,"Emptying bin issue, same as usual with Dyson","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hoped Dyson fixed issue to make easier fully empty trash bin. But, I guess not. They did raised price drastically, though. In order you to empty fully bin, you have to use some stick to pull it out and get dirt everywhere. Dyson, if you can came out with ideas, look at least around and learn from your competitors...",Vladislav,2024-07-23T18:25:46
JennG_2024-07-17,1,Terrible,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Had to return the first one- luckily had geek squad who said there were so many issues i could get a new one... except it wasn't new. This one is even more messed up than the first. Had a dyson animal with no issues fir a few years- this is our 2nd and once again ill have to drive 45min to a best buy for geek squad to tell me the same thing as the first time. For the $$$ you expect it to last at LEAST a year, this is ridiculous",JennG,2024-07-17T18:37:11
Roxy_2024-07-02,1,Not trigger happy,"I received my new Dyson v15 about 2 weeks ago. I was extremely disappointed to learn the unit only runs when trigger is pulled….an uncomfortable, poorly designed, trigger on top section where the heavy battery is housed. The unit does not have an “on off” switch.",Roxy,2024-07-02T21:06:51
Steph_2024-06-25,1,Canister does not completely empty.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my second Dyson and if it would’ve been my first one, I can say with all certainty I wouldn’t own another Dyson. The canister doesn’t empty well as. You have to dig the hair out. The canister is heavy.",Steph,2024-06-25T23:07:39

LGWowcast_2024-03-30,1,Vacuum cleaner,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I do not recommend this product. I bought one on August 6, 2023 and it turns off, meaning it cannot be used.",LGWowcast,2024-03-30T21:33:37

KaileeN_2024-03-04,1,Mediocre not worth the money!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Heavy. Loud. Hurts your ears, has impeccable high pitch sound that leaves you sort of deaf for awhile. Mediocre clean— was expecting more for the price.",KaileeN,2024-03-04T22:20:51
DPHG_2024-02-26,1,To many cons for the price tag,"I received this vacuum last week. For such an expensive cordless vacuum the cons are too big to let them: - the suction is bad, I expected to be a better option then the broom. - vacuuming any type of carpet will not work - cleaning the vacuum bag of pet hair is a hard task - to keep the vacuum ON you need to keep your ginger pressed on button - one of the attachments does not properly stays hooked - wight wise this machine is not an important on handling it vs. the regular vacuum",DPHG,2024-02-26T14:03:34

ElizabethS_2024-01-13,1,Hate it!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hate this vacuum!I had one previously that worked fine. I didn’t love that one either, but my husband did.This one got rave reviews so I bought it and all new rugs at the same time.It has been 6 months and it continues to jam, w/ each use, so I have to manually extract the debris.The attachments are very difficult to remove.I spent a fortune and now I am buying a cheap Shark that I bought for my son. It is so much better and only $200! It is a plug in, but I don’t care.",ElizabethS,2024-01-13T01:25:00

Dyson_2024-01-04,1,Horrible,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely hated this vacuum. It was hard to hold the handle down while trying to vacuum. The suction seemed good on the hard floor, but on carpet it wasn’t very good. I don’t recommend this.",Dyson,2024-01-04T02:20:47
